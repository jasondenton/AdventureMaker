<h2>Sublime Integration</h2>

<p>The easiest way to use AdventureMaker is with the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime 3
Text Editor</a>. Once you
have installed Sublime, you may download and install the appropriate AdventureMaker integration
package for your system. This will allow you to set the <tt>Tools | Build System</tt> option in 
Sublime to AdvMaker, and then submit your adventure to AdventureMaker by
hitting <strong>CTRL+B</strong> (<strong>CTRL+B</strong> on a Mac).</p>

<p>One of the Sublime integration packages is all you need to setup AdventureMaker
on your computer. You do not need to also install on of command line client scripts below.</p>

<p>On Windows, unpack the integration bundle and double click on the <i>setup</i> file
(may appear as setup.bat). On a mac, unpack the archive and right click on
<i>advmaker.pkg</i>. Select the option for Installer and follow the prompts
to install the package.</p>

<h2>AdventureMaker for Windows</h2>

<p>If you would rather use a different editor than Sublime on Windows, you may use the
stand alone AdventureMaker client software for Windows. This is command line software,
which must be executed from a command shell on Windows. The AdventureMaker client
for windows includes copies of the zip and unzip utilities and the curl program.
A batch file called advmaker.bat ties them together. To install the stand alone
windows program, download the install package below, unzip it, and place the resulting
folder in the <i>Program Files</i> directory. Then, edit your windows path to include
<i>C:\Program Files\AdventureMaker</i>.</p>

<p>To use the stand alone windows client, create an AdventureMaker project directory or use
the one provided in the quick start bundle. Open a command prompt, change to the project 
directory, and run <i>advmaker.bat</i>. This will submit your adventure to AdventureMaker,
and unpack the results to the <i>finished</i> sub-directory.</p>

<h2>AdventureMaker for Mac or Unix</h2>

<p>If you would rather use a different editor than Sublime on a Mac or other Unix based
system, you may use the stand along AdventureMaker client script. This script
assumes you already have the zip, unzip, and curl program installed on your system. Mac
computers come with these utilities pre-installed; as do many Linux systems. Once these
program are installed, download the stand alone AdventureMaker script and place it
somewhere on your path.</p>

<p>To use the stand alone max/unix script, create an AdventureMaker project directory or use
the one provided in the quick start bundle. Open a command prompt, change to the project 
directory, and run <i>advmaker.sh</i>. This will submit your adventure to AdventureMaker,
and unpack the results to the <i>finished</i> sub-directory.</p>

<h2>Quick Start and Live Tutorial</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started writing adventures with AdventureMaker is to download
and unpack the QuickStart adventure project bundle. This provides a working example
that demonstrates the use of AdventureMaker's major features. The text of the adventure
explains how many of these features work, and you can immediately submit the quick start
project to AdventureMaker to see how the software turns what you write into a 
finished adventure.</p>
