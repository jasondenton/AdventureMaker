<h1>AdventureMaker</h1>

<p>AdventureMaker allows you to write adventures for 
<a href="http://dnd.wizards.com">Dungeon &amp; Dragons 5th edition</a> using a simple markup system,
and then quickly produces finished PDF files containing all the monster stat blocks, XP charts, treasure tables,
and other technical details. AdventureMaker worries about the formatting so you can concentrate on the creative
work of writing the adventure. It will even produce the Fantasy Grounds MOD file for you.</p>

<p>The easiest way to use AdventureMaker is to install the 
<a href="https://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime 3 Text editor</a>,
and then install the AdventureMaker integration bundle for your system.</p>

<h2>Your First Adventure</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get started writing adventures with AdventureMaker is to download
and unpack the QuickStart adventure project bundle. This provides a working example
that demonstrates the use of AdventureMaker's major features. The text of the adventure
explains how many of these features work, and you can immediately submit the quick start
project to AdventureMaker to see how the software turns what you write into a 
finished adventure.</p>

<p>Open the <i>adventure.adv</i> file found in the quick start bundle with Sublime. Then, 
select <strong>Tools | Build System | AdvMaker</strong> to set Sublime to use AdvMaker as the
build system. Hit CTRL+B (CMD+B on the Mac) to send your adventure to AdventureMaker. After
a few minutes, it will return the results and you can find the finished <i>adventure.pdf</i>
file in the new <i>finished</i> sub-directory.</p>
