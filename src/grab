('>', ' from the bog, and the air reeks of decay. Your feet sink into the muck, and the water reaches your waist.')
('>', ' Insects swarm in the air, and at the edges of your vision you catch fleeting glimpses of motion.')
('', 'If the characters are still in the swamp when the orb detonates, they get pounded by the resulting')
('', 'waves but otherwise come through unharmed.')
('>', ' You are deep inside the Flooded Forest when the box containing the orb finally fails. The orb gives one')
('>', ' final pulse of energy, and then A great tremor rolls through the marshy ground. Great waves sweep ')
('>', ' over you, sweeping you under the water.')
('>', ' You struggle towards the surface, but for what seems like an eternity it eludes you. Your feet scrape the bottom,')
('>', ' and then get stuck in the mud. Frantically you push off the bottom. At last you break the surface and gulp')
('>', ' air before the waves wash over you again. But in a moment your head is above water again. As the waves')
('>', ' subside it becomes easier to stay afloat, until you are once again able to stand amidst quickly subsiding waves.')
('>', ' A few minutes later, the only sign that the orb detonated is that a few more trees have gone from upright to')
('>', ' floating in the bog.')
('', "Thulman's keep sits close to the mouth of the River Lis, where the river is 400 feet wide and the current")
('', 'is very swift. Characters using magic such as dimension door or water walking can cross it without difficult,')
('', 'but it should be clear to them that attempting to make a raft will likely take more time than they')
('', 'have before the orb detonates. It should be clear that attempting to swim the river is very dangerous,')
('', 'although a strong character could do it without their armor. If the skiff survived the trip to the keep, that')

('>', ' You are deep inside the Cormanthor forest when the box containing the orb finally fails. The orb gives one')
('>', ' final pulse of energy, and then the ground begins to tremble violently. The shaking goes on and on,')
('>', ' and around you trees are uprooted and fall to the ground. When at last the ground stops shaking, the forest')
('>', ' has been flattened for as far as the eye can see. You stand admist a circle of toppled trees. The forest')
('>', ' is strangely silent, any creature who can has fled. It may be best if you too fled the area, before the elves')
('>', ' who hold the forest sacred come to investigate.')
('', "If the orb is brought to the surface before it detonates, but left in Thulman's Keep or the immediate vicinity,")
('', 'the keep is destroyed when the orb detonates. This includes the eastern tower, on the opposite')

('>', ' and then buckles. The keep shakes itself apart, and you must dodge falling debris as it comes down around you. ')
('>', " The ground splits apart, and you must dash for safety as the ground cracks open and swallows Thulman's keep.")
('>', ' For a split second you think you have dashed to safety, but ground continues to collapse into a sinkhole, and ')
('>', ' the river rushed into to fill the void. You try to run again, but the river over takes you. At last the shaking')
('>', ' stops and you come up for air. Coughing and gasping you drag your self out of the churning waters and onto the')
('>', ' newly formed bank of the river. For many minutes you watch the river as it violently adjusts to its new course,')
('>', ' but at last the waters resume their normal flow. There is now a small lake, surrounded by uprooted trees, ')
('>', ' at the southern end of the River Lis, but at least the river remains passable for ships. The devastation')
('>', ' wrought by the orb could have been much worse.')

('>', ' High above the earth, the box holding the orb trembles, then disintegrates. The orb crumbles, and a wave of')

('', "If the skiff survived the trip to Thulman's keep, the orb and its box can be carried out into the")

('', 'An hour later the orb detonates, sending huge waves to beat against the shore. As there are no')
('', 'nearby settlements, there is no damage.')
('>', ' You watch as the wind blows your skiff into the waters off the moonsea. Eventually, it becomes just a tiny')
('>', ' blob on the horizon. Then the blob is gone. A few moments later a huge wall of waters comes hurtling towards')
('>', ' the shore, and you scramble for higher ground. For several minutes huge waves pound the beach, but then ')
('>', ' they subside. The orb has detonated without causing any lasting harm. You have a long walk back to ')
('>', ' civilization, but whatever nefarious purpose the orb has meant to fulfill has been thwarted.')
('', 'If one or more characters choses to sail the boat themselves, the boat gets a little further out into the Moonsea')
('', 'before the orb detonates. When it does, it shakes the skiff to pieces. Whomever is on board ends up in the water,')
