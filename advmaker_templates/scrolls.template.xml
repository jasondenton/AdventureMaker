<h>Spell Scrolls</h>
<p>A spell scroll contains the spell. If that spell is on your spell list, you can use an action to read
the scroll and cast the spell without having to provide any of the spell's components. Otherwise, the scroll is
unintelligible. If the spell is of a higher level than you can normally cast, make an ability check using your
spellcasting ability against a DC of 10 + the spell's level. On a failed check there is no effect.
Regardless of success or failure, once used the scroll crumbles to dust.</p>
